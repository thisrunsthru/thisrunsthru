10/20/2025 at 11:53 pm - the mariners lost game 7 to toronto this evening.  thus, their chances of appearing in the 2025 world series have been reduced to ZERO.
10/31/2025 at 12:03 pm - the majority of my seattle teams are doing excellent.  uw huskies football, seattle sounders fc, mariners, seattle kraken, washington state cougar football, and coming very soon will be the much loved gonzaga bulldog men's basketball team coached by none other than the best college basketball coach of all time Mr. Mark Few!  The Seattle Sounders FC are in the Audi 2025 MLS Cup Playoffs Round 1, which is a best out of 3 series.  unfortunately the sounders lost the first game in heartbreaking fashion!  Normally the match would have resulted in a nill nill draw, but since this is the postseason, no draws.  It came down to penalty kicks and they - the loons of minnesota - beat us 3 PKs to 2 PKs.  Now they are ahead 1 game to 0 games with game 2 occurring on November 3rd at Lumen Field start time of 7:45pm.  Which strikes me as quite late for a sporting contest in November.  Will it snow maybe?  It sure could.
