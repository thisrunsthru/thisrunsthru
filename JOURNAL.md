on the afternoon of 7/25/25 i sourced three green bars from prd at airport and holgate in the sodo zone soda zone.  instead of even and responsible redosing after the initial dose of 1.5 tabs i irresponsibly finished the remainder of what i hadnt taken yet while sitting at an spl workstation on the fifth floor of central branch. blackout was initiated before any long term memory formation occurred beyond initial logging in to a shared-use workstation. wait. my last memory prior to blacking was printing out 2 months worth of my google calendar account kb at gmail dot com. after discharge from hmc ed i discovered that I had checked out and lost spl material effectively tanking my pristine spl reputation since my plethora of lost materials fines totalling over 200 usd was purged and forgiven on my birthday in either 2023 or 2024. i will only have to repay the cost of a fairly short not well known nonfiction hardcover. no checkout of materials until sum is paid in full. workstation use is available even with fines regardless of total sum. borrowers must agree to and adhere to at least a 5 usd per month payment plan to qualify for monitored checkout of one book at a time and the material must be manually checked out by spl officials at front reception desk. more tba - ps Capacities for Android is failing to resolve to the login page where input of email and password is requested. when app is loaded the Capacities logo appears on a blank background indefinitely. new Nokia G300 5G Android 11 smartphone arrived and booted 8/3/25. awaiting return email asking if the Capacities API is down. more later. bk.
